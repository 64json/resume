# Jinseo Jason Park's Resume

If you are not a recruiter (or even if you are), you may wanna check out [my website](http://jasonpark.me/) rather than this tedious resume.

## Creating Documents in PDF Sucks

I build my resume with HTML and then let Chrome do the thing.

Here is the printer settings.
* Destination: Save as PDF
* Paper size: US Letter
* Margins: None
* Scale: 140

Someday maybe I will make an automated converter. *Maybe*.
